Thank you for loving someone as dramatic, overthinking, slightly annoying, and completely obsessed with you as me.

Thank you for staying after our countless baseless stupid fights. And thank you for always shutting me up when I say things like “what if you go away someday” because honestly, I deserve a tight virtual slap for even imagining a world where you’re not mine.

Because you are mine.

And I am yours.

No distance changes that. No fight changes that. No bad day changes that.

I love that even when we argue, we still end up choosing each other again and again. I love that even miles apart, you still feel like home. I love that you stay… even when I’m not easy to stay with.

So keep fighting me when I’m wrong. Keep pulling me back when I drift into nonsense. Keep reminding me that we’re us.

Because I’m yours.

And you’re mine.

Always.

I promise to keep loving you like this forever, even during our lows, even if you end up hating me, I'll still keep loving you. I promise to keep choosing you, every day, no matter what. I promise to keep being dramatic and overthinking and annoying, because that’s just part of the package deal of loving me.
I promise to keep being obsessed with you, because I am obsessed with you. I promise to keep being yours, and to keep loving you, for the rest of my life. I am always here for you, no matter what.
